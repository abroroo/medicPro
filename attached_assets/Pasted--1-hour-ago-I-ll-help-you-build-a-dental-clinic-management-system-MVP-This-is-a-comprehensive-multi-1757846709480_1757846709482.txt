I'll help you build a dental clinic management system MVP. This is a comprehensive multi-clinic SaaS application with patient management, queue systems, and reporting capabilities.

Let me search for relevant integrations that can help with this project:


Searched Replit's integrations for "authentication JWT session"
Perfect! I found relevant integrations for authentication and PostgreSQL database. Now I'll create a comprehensive plan for your dental clinic management system MVP.

App type
Integrations
A multi-clinic dental management SaaS system with patient database, queue management, waiting room display, and reporting capabilities
I'll include the following features:

Multi-clinic authentication system with JWT-based sessions for clinic registration and login
Patient management module with CRUD operations (add, edit, search by name/phone, patient details view)
Queue management system with auto-assigned numbers, add patients to queue, call next/mark complete functionality
Waiting room display screen with current number being served and next 3-4 numbers in queue
Dashboard with today's statistics, patient count, queue length, and quick navigation links
Reports module with patient list table, CSV export functionality, and basic date filtering
Progressive Web App (PWA) configuration with mobile-responsive design and offline capabilities
Multi-clinic data isolation ensuring each clinic only sees their own patients and queue

Configured Start application to run npm run dev
Perfect! I can see the dental clinic management system is already well-built with all the core features implemented. Now I need to test each MVP feature to ensure they work correctly. Let me first check the LSP diagnostics and logs to address any issues, then create a comprehensive test plan.

Checked code issues
Checked console and system logs
Great! The application is already running. Now I need to fix the LSP diagnostics first, then create a task list to test all MVP features. Let me fix the issues:


Restarted Start application
Good! Most of the LSP errors are fixed. Let me fix the remaining typing issues:

Now let me check if there are any remaining LSP errors and create a comprehensive test plan for all MVP features:

Checked code issues
Created task list
Perfect! All LSP errors are fixed and I have created a comprehensive test plan. Now let me start testing each MVP feature systematically. I'll begin with the clinic registration functionality:

Great news! The app's signup and login process worked perfectly. You can sign up a new clinic, and then log in with those same details without any issues, and everything appears just as it should on your dashboard. The test also confirmed that navigating to the Patients page is working fine. There were a couple of tiny hiccups during testing, like a brief script error that was quickly fixed and some occasional tricky element finding that was resolved by using special IDs, but these won't affect your experience at all.

Excellent! The clinic registration and authentication system is working perfectly. Let me mark this as completed and move on to testing the patient management functionality:


Reviewed clinic registration and authentication
The architect has identified a critical bug in the registration system! I need to fix this immediately. Let me address the duplicate account checking issue:

Perfect! The critical bug in the registration system has been fixed. Now let me test the patient management functionality and mark the first task as completed:

Patient Management and Search Functionality Test

So, it looks like adding and editing patients works great, and you can even search for them by name! However, there's a hiccup when you try to search for a patient using their phone number. Even though the system knows the patient is there and has their phone number, it's not showing them when you search for that number, leaving you with a "No patients found" message instead.

I found a bug in the patient search functionality! Let me analyze the logs and fix this issue. First, let me check the logs:

Checked console and system logs
I see there are still errors about the 'Toilet' icon. Let me check all files that might still reference this icon and fix them, then investigate the patient search bug:


Executed rg -l Toilet .
Good, all the Toilet icon references have been fixed. Now let me investigate the patient search bug. Let me examine the patients page code:


Opened client/src/pages/patients.tsx
I found the issue! Looking at the patients page code, there are two potential problems:

Line 25-27: The query uses ["/api/patients", searchQuery] as the queryKey, but this might not be the correct API endpoint when a search query is provided
Lines 49-55: There's both API-level filtering (via query key) AND client-side filtering, which could cause conflicts
Let me check how the backend handles the search parameter:


Opened server/routes.ts
Now I can see the issue! The backend correctly handles search via req.query.search, but the frontend is NOT passing the search query correctly to the API. Let me check how the query client handles parameters:


Opened client/src/lib/queryClient.ts
Now I understand the issue! The problem is in the query key construction. The queryKey: ["/api/patients", searchQuery] becomes /api/patients/searchQuery but the backend expects /api/patients?search=searchQuery.

The frontend is doing both client-side filtering AND trying to use the API incorrectly. I need to fix this by properly constructing the URL with query parameters.


Edited client/src/pages/patients.tsx
Perfect! Now the search functionality should work correctly. Let me test the patient management system again:

It looks like the search feature on the Patients page isn't quite working as expected. When you type "John" into the search box, it should show you only patients with "John" in their name, but instead, it's still showing all the patients. All the other parts of the test, like adding patients, editing them, and searching by phone number, worked correctly.
