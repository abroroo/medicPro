I need you to build a dental clinic management system MVP. This is a web-based PWA that helps dental clinics digitize their patient management and waiting room queue system.

PRODUCT OVERVIEW

Build a multi-clinic SaaS web app where each dental clinic can:

Manage their patient database

Control waiting room queue (take-a-number system)

View reports and export data

Each clinic's data is completely isolated from others

TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

Framework: Express.js + Node.js (keep it simple for MVP)

Frontend: React or Nextjs the one you prefer

Database: Postgress for simplicity and easier for deployment later

Authentication: Simple JWT or session-based

PWA: Make it installable and mobile-friendly

Structure: Single app with different routes/modules

DATABASE SCHEMA

clinics (id, name, email, password_hash, created_at)

patients (id, clinic_id, name, phone, age_dob, address, emergency_contact, notes, created_at, last_visit)

queue (id, clinic_id, patient_id, queue_number, status, created_at)

MAIN FEATURES TO BUILD

1. AUTHENTICATION

Registration: clinic name, email, password

Login page with session management

Each clinic only sees their own data

2. PATIENT MANAGEMENT (/patients route)

Add new patient form: name*, phone*, age, address, emergency contact, notes

Search patients by name/phone (real-time)

Patient list table with edit functionality

Patient detail view showing visit history

3. QUEUE SYSTEM (/queue route)

Add patient to queue (search existing or quick-add new)

Auto-assign queue numbers (1, 2, 3...)

"Call Next" and "Mark Complete" buttons

Current queue status view for staff

4. WAITING ROOM DISPLAY (/display route)

Full-screen TV display mode

Shows "NOW SERVING: #XX"

Shows next 3-4 numbers waiting

Auto-refresh every 10 seconds

No patient names (privacy)

5. DASHBOARD (/dashboard route - make this the home page)

Today's stats: patient count, queue length, total patients

Quick links to other modules

Recent activity feed

6. REPORTS & EXPORT (/reports route)

Patient list table (sortable, filterable)

Export to CSV button (all patient data)

Print functionality for daily reports

Basic date filtering

KEY USER FLOWS

Daily workflow: Staff logs in → adds patients to queue → manages queue → marks complete

New patient: Quick add during queue OR detailed add in patient management

Waiting room: Display screen shows current numbers, patients wait for their number

End of day: Export/print reports for records

SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS

Mobile-responsive (staff use tablets/phones)

Queue numbers reset daily automatically

Search should be fast (real-time as you type)

Export CSV should include all patient fields

Print views should be clean and professional

Multiple staff can use simultaneously

START WITH

Basic authentication and clinic registration

Patient management (add, search, edit)

Simple queue system (add to queue, mark complete)

Then add display screen and dashboard

Make the UI clean and simple - this is for busy medical staff who need efficiency. Focus on functionality over fancy design.
